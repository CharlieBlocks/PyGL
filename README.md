# PyGL
A render engine similar to OpenGL that runs natively on python. Mainly targeted towards simply 3D games and visualisation of information.

To do:
    Rewrtie the code so it is less object oriented and more mathematicly exposed to allow for CUDA acceleration using numba.
    Restructure the code so it is more libary like and has a greater level of modularity.
